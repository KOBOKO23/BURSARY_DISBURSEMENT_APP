# Bursary Disbursement App

## Project Description

The Bursary Disbursement App is designed to streamline the process of disbursing bursaries to eligible students. It connects secondary schools and colleges, verifies student eligibility based on predefined criteria, and allows institutions to add new students and institutions seamlessly. Once a student qualifies for a bursary, the information is automatically visible to the respective institution or sent directly to the student or guardian's phone number.

This application is built using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for managing bursary disbursements.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a crucial component of the Bursary Disbursement App. It allows users to interact with the app's backend, managing bursary records, institutions, and student information through a command-line interface.

### How to Start the Command Interpreter

To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository from GitHub.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bursary-disbursement-app.git
   cd bursary-disbursement-app
   ```

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment**: Create and activate a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Interpreter**: Start the command interpreter.
   ```bash
   python3 console.py
   ```

### How to Use the Command Interpreter

The command interpreter supports various commands to manage the bursary system. Below are some of the primary commands you can use:

- **Create a new institution**:
  ```bash
  create Institution name="Institution Name" address="Institution Address" contact="Contact Info"
  ```

- **Create a new student**:
  ```bash
  create Student name="Student Name" age=18 institution_id="Institution ID"
  ```

- **Show details of an institution**:
  ```bash
  show Institution institution_id
  ```

- **Update an institution's details**:
  ```bash
  update Institution institution_id name="New Institution Name"
  ```

- **Delete a student**:
  ```bash
  delete Student student_id
  ```

- **List all institutions**:
  ```bash
  all Institution
  ```

- **List all students**:
  ```bash
  all Student
  ```

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

1. **Creating an Institution**:
   ```bash
   $ create Institution name="Green Valley High School" address="123 Green Valley Road" contact="0712345678"
   Institution created with ID: 1
   ```

2. **Adding a Student**:
   ```bash
   $ create Student name="Jane Doe" age=17 institution_id=1
   Student created with ID: 1
   ```

3. **Listing All Institutions**:
   ```bash
   $ all Institution
   [
     {"id": 1, "name": "Green Valley High School", "address": "123 Green Valley Road", "contact": "0712345678"}
   ]
   ```

4. **Updating an Institution's Details**:
   ```bash
   $ update Institution 1 name="Green Valley Secondary School"
   Institution updated successfully
   ```

5. **Deleting a Student**:
   ```bash
   $ delete Student 1
   Student deleted successfully
   ```

### Execution

The shell works in two modes: **interactive** and **non-interactive**.

#### Interactive Mode

In interactive mode, the shell works as follows:

```bash
$ ./console.py
(bursary_app) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(bursary_app) 
(bursary_app) quit
$
```

#### Non-Interactive Mode

In non-interactive mode, the shell can execute commands passed via standard input:

```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(bursary_app)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(bursary_app) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(bursary_app)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(bursary_app) 
$
```

## Conclusion

The Bursary Disbursement App is an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing bursaries. By using the command interpreter, users can easily create, update, and manage institutions and students within the system. This app aims to simplify the bursary disbursement process, ensuring transparency and accuracy.
